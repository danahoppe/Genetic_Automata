# Genetic_Automata
Genetic-Simulator

------------------------------------------

This program utlizes a 2D map of 'blocks' to simulate organic behavior of 'ants' and select for trait values over each generation that optimize their food finding and cooperative success.

Ants utilize optimal search algorithms and efficient path retracing methods to simulate natural behavior. They leave scents that fade over time and lead other ants to food sources.

Each new ant has the attribute of its parents plus or minus a slight genetic drift value to represent mutation.
